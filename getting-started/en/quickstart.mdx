</Warning>

## Front-end

There are two ways to use Bawabah in your project:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hosted Login" icon="page" horizontal href="development/en/hosted-login">
    A login page hosted on Bawabah website redirects user to your website after login.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Form Login" icon="envelope" horizontal href="development/en/form-login">
    A login form can be used anywhere on your website.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

And here is a comparison between both integration methods:

| Comparison       | **Hosted Login** | **Form Login** |
| ---------------- | :--------------: | :------------: |
| Login Page       | Ready-to-use     | make your own  |
| Login Happens in | Bawabah website  | your website   |
| Design           | CSS only         | Unlimited      |
| Page Contents    | Login Only       | Unlimited      |
| App Review Time  | Quicker          | Normal         |
| Setup            | Easy             | Professional   |
| Price            | Free             | -              |

### Setup Hosted Login

Use the URL below to login users to your website:

```
https://bawabah.app/login?appId={your-app-id}&callbackUrl={your-callback-url}&fullscreen=true
```

> Replace `{your-app-id}` with your appId and `{your-callback-url}`with your callback URL From [Create Your First App](#create-your-first-app) Step.

When users click the login button on your website, they are redirected to the hosted login page URL. After completing the login process, they will be redirected back to your website via the callback URL, which includes a `sessionId` query parameter for the user session to capture.

**For Example:**\
If your appId is `4y83w4f` And your callback URL is `https://mywebsite.com/login/callback` Then the hosted login URL will be `https://bawabah.app/login?appId=4y83w4f&callbackUrl=https://mywebsite.com/login/callback&fullscreen=true`
